# Genome-Network-Analysis
## Creation of Genome Netowrks:

### Genome Networks:
### Used to show relationships between multiple genomes (both within and between species), with "nodes" representing individual genomes and "edges" connecting related genomes together
### Multiple different netowrks can be produce for the same nodes through different methods (using different tools and thresholds)
### Ex: VSEARCH/USEARCH - Used to create the genome networks, command is cluster_fast, with thresholds between .35-.75
    ### CD-HIT - another network creating tool



## Analysis/Comparison of Genome Networks:
### Principal Components Analysis
### Used to extract the dominant patterns in a data matrix
### SNAP.py (SNAP for Python) - Used to compare and analyze netowrks -> can be applied to genome networks, two versions: C++ and Python
